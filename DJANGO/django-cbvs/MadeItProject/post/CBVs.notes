Tips for Writing Class-Based Views:
  • Stick with the defaults
  • Don’t go crazy with multiple inheritance
  • For authentication and other behaviors: django-braces
  • For quick reference documentation: https://ccbv.co.uk
  • If doing something crazy-sophisticated, drop down to a
  basic django.views.generic.View.
  • For more advanced views:
  – GET/POST arguments are inside of self.kwargs
  – You can access the request at self.request
